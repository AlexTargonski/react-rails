Lorem Ipsum є, фактично, стандартною \"рибою\" аж з XVI сторіччя, коли невідомий друкар взяв шрифтову гранку та склав на ній підбірку зразків шрифтів. \"Риба\" не тільки успішно пережила п'ять століть, але й прижилася в електронному верстуванні, залишаючись по суті незмінною. Вона популяризувалась в 60-их роках минулого сторіччя завдяки виданню зразків шрифтів Letraset, які містили уривки з Lorem Ipsum, і вдруге - нещодавно завдяки програмам комп'ютерного верстування на кшталт Aldus Pagemaker, які використовували різні версії Lorem Ipsum. Чому ми ним користуємось?  Вже давно відомо, що читабельний зміст буде заважати зосередитись людині, яка оцінює композицію сторінки. Сенс використання Lorem Ipsum полягає в тому, що цей текст має більш-менш нормальне розподілення літер на відміну від, наприклад, \"Тут іде текст. Тут іде текст.\" Це робить текст схожим на оповідний. Багато програм верстування та веб-дизайну використовують Lorem Ipsum як зразок і пошук за терміном \"lorem ipsum\" відкриє багато веб-сайтів, які знаходяться ще в зародковому стані. Різні версії Lorem Ipsum з'явились за минулі роки, деякі випадково, деякі було створено зумисно (зокрема, жартівливі).  Звідки він походить?  На відміну від поширеної думки Lorem Ipsum не є випадковим набором літер. Він походить з уривку класичної латинської літератури 45 року до н.е., тобто має більш як 2000-річну історію. Річард Макклінток, професор латини з коледжу Хемпдін-Сидні, що у Вірджінії, вивчав одне з найменш зрозумілих латинських слів - consectetur - з уривку Lorem Ipsum, і у пошуку цього слова в класичній літературі знайшов безсумнівне джерело. Lorem Ipsum походить з розділів 1.10.32 та 1.10.33 цицеронівського \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" (\"Про межі добра і зла\"), написаного у 45 році до н.е. Цей трактат з теорії етики був дуже популярним в епоху Відродження. Перший рядок Lorem Ipsum, \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...\" походить з одного з рядків розділу 1.10.32.  Класичний текст, використовуваний з XVI сторіччя, наведено нижче для всіх зацікавлених. Також точно за оригіналом наведено розділи 1.10.32 та 1.10.33 цицеронівського \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" разом із перекладом англійською, виконаним 1914 року Х.Рекемом.", "priority"=>"2"}}

Чому ми ним користуємось?  Вже давно відомо, що читабельний зміст буде заважати зосередитись людині, яка оцінює композицію сторінки. Сенс використання Lorem Ipsum полягає в тому, що цей текст має більш-менш нормальне розподілення літер на відміну від, наприклад, \"Тут іде текст. Тут іде текст.\" Це робить текст схожим на оповідний. Багато програм верстування та веб-дизайну використовують Lorem Ipsum як зразок і пошук за терміном \"lorem ipsum\" відкриє багато веб-сайтів, які знаходяться ще в зародковому стані. Різні версії Lorem Ipsum з'явились за минулі роки, деякі випадково, деякі було створено зумисно (зокрема, жартівливі).  Звідки він походить?  На відміну від поширеної думки Lorem Ipsum не є випадковим набором літер. Він походить з уривку класичної латинської літератури 45 року до н.е., тобто має більш як 2000-річну історію. Річард Макклінток, професор латини з коледжу Хемпдін-Сидні, що у Вірджінії, вивчав одне з найменш зрозумілих латинських слів - consectetur - з уривку Lorem Ipsum, і у пошуку цього слова в класичній літературі знайшов безсумнівне джерело. Lorem Ipsum походить з розділів 1.10.32 та 1.10.33 цицеронівського \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" (\"Про межі добра і зла\"), написаного у 45 році до н.е. Цей трактат з теорії етики був дуже популярним в епоху Відродження. Перший рядок Lorem Ipsum, \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...\" походить з одного з рядків розділу 1.10.32.  Класичний текст, використовуваний з XVI сторіччя, наведено нижче для всіх зацікавлених. Також точно за оригіналом наведено розділи 1.10.32 та 1.10.33 цицеронівського \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" разом із перекладом англійською, виконаним 1914 року Х.Рекемом."], ["priority", 2], ["created_at", 2017-05-08 11:47:17 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-05-08 11:47:17 UTC]]
